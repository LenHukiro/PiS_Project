/**
 * This package contains the game view of the project.
 * <p>
 * The view creates a GUI with the processing library and uses a GameController to manage the data inside the GUI.
 * <p></p>
 * The view uses internally the class Board, which stores instances of the class Cells, which can mark or contain a Piece.
 * The GameView displays the board and additional GUI Components to show the user meaningful data for the game.
