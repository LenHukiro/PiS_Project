/**
 * This package contains the game logic of the project.
 * <p>
 * In order to play the game a view or controller are not needed, but are optional if a GUI is desired to play the game on.
 * <p>
 * The game itself can be played with the jShell, by creating a new GameModel constructor and using the answer method.
 * The answer method takes a boolean, if the printed statement above is correct or incorrect.
 * In the background is a clock running, which time can be set via the constructor, if the player wants more/less time to play with.
 * After the time expired the game ends, with the number of correct answers being printed.
